        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>5 large russet potatoes, peeled and rinsed</li>
          <li>1 quart vegetable oil, <em>can substitute canola oil</em></li>
          <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Slice the potatoes into <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch thick sticks.</li>
          <li>Soak the potato slices in cold water for a minimum of one hour, and up to overnight. The longer, the better as this process removes the starch which makes for extra crispy fries.</li>
          <li>Rinse the fries twice with cold water.</li>
          <li>Lay the fries on paper towels or a clean dishcloth and pat them dry as dry as possible.</li>
          <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or dutch oven to 300 degrees F. You'll need to fry in about three batches, begin with a quart of oil and add more as needed. Frying too many at once makes them less crispy.</li>
          <li>Use a slotted spoon to add the potatoes to the oil and fry for about 5-6 minutes. The oil should bubble lightly, we're only heating the potatoes, we don't want them to crisp yet.</li>
          <li>Place the cooked potatoes on a paper towel lined plate and fry the rest of the remaining batches.</li>
          <li>Increase the heat to 400 degrees F and fry each batch a second time until they are crisp and golden-brown, about 5 minutes or so.</li>
          <li>Remove them and place them on dry paper towels. Sprinkle with salt as soon as they come out.</li>
          <li>Serve with ketchup or fry sauce and enjoy!</li>
