    <p>Meatwad is a very easy character to translate into real life. After all, he<br>
    is simply a ball of raw beef.</p>

    <p>I do not suggest eating this dish, leave it for garnish and do not let it<br>
    touch the actual cooked food.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ground beef</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Take your preferred amount of ground beef and roll it into a ball.</li>
      <li>Do not cook, do not eat, maybe serve. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
