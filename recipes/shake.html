    <p>Master Shake's real life counterpart is obviously a milkshake. The problem<br>
      is that the flavor is unknown. In the first season he shot out a green<br>
      substance, but in later seasons it was white.
    </p>

    <p>To be safe we can say that he is a vanilla milkshake who might be add a mint<br>
      flavor in March, you know, for Saint Patricks Day.
