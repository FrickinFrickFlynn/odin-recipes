# Odin Recipes: My First Project


### Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a recipe website containing three
recipes. It will have the recipe's description, ingredient list,
cooking procedure, and picture. The homepage will link to the three
webpages that contain the individual recipes.

### What I Learn:
This project is a part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) and it is for the "HTML Foundations" 
section. By building the project I reinforce what I learned in the unit.
Basic HTML elements like paragraphs, lists, images, anchors and, headings
will be used to construct the website. I am also learning about Git which
makes this project a perfect time to practice it.

### Reflection:
After I finish the project I will update this file to write my reflection.
