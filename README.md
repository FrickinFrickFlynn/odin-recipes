# Odin Recipes: My First Project


### Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a recipe website containing three
recipes. It will have the recipe's description, ingredient list,
cooking procedure, and picture. The homepage will link to the three
webpages that contain the individual recipes.

### What I Learn:
This project is a part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) and it is for the "HTML Foundations" 
section. By building the project I reinforce what I learned in the unit.
Basic HTML elements like paragraphs, lists, images, anchors and, headings
will be used to construct the website. I am also learning about Git which
makes this project a perfect time to practice it.

### Reflection:
Overall, I found the project to be a fun way to practice HTML. I used only
HTML and only the elements shown in the unit. It was not very difficult
or intensive due to the limited amount of elements at my disposal and
lack of CSS. I'm excited to see what the rest of the course has to offer!
